## Features

This project is built using [Xterm.js](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/), and [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink) üôè

- Runs WASI Wasm modules using [@wasmer/wasi](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js/tree/master/packages/wasi) and [@wasmer/wasmfs](https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer-js/tree/master/packages/wasmfs). üèÉ

- Provides a terminal-like experience, with stuff like autocomplete, hotkeys, pipes, and more! üë©‚Äçüíª

- Allows passing in your own custom Wasm binaries, or callback commands to provide commands in the shell! ‚öôÔ∏è

- Runs processes in seperate web workers using [Comlink](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/comlink)! üîó

- Exports a command fetcher for fetching packages from [WAPM](https://wapm.io/)! üì¶

## Installation

For installing `@wasmer/wasm-terminal`, just run this command in your shell:

```bash
npm install --save @wasmer/wasm-terminal
```

## Quick Start

**Javascript**

```javascript
import WasmTerminal, { fetchCommandFromWAPM } from "@wasmer/wasm-terminal";
import wasmInit, { lowerI64Imports } from "@wasmer/wasm-transformer";

// URL for where the wasm-transformer wasm file is located. This is probably different depending on your bundler.
const wasmTransformerWasmUrl = "node_modules/@wasmer/wasm-transformer/wasm_transformer_bg.wasm";

// Let's write handler for the fetchCommand property of the WasmTerminal Config.
const fetchCommandHandler = async (commandName: string) => {

  // Let's return a "CallbackCommand" if our command matches a special name
  if (commandName === 'callback-command') {
    const callbackCommand = async (args: string[], stdin: string) => {
      return `Callback Command Working! Args: ${args}, stdin: ${stdin}`
    }
    return callbackCommand;
  }

  // Let's fetch a wasm Binary from WAPM for the command name.
  const wasmBinary = await fetchCommandFromWAPM(commandName);

  // Initialize the Wasm Transformer, and use it to lower
  // i64 imports from Wasi Modules, so that most Wasi modules
  // Can run in a Javascript context.
  await wasmInit(wasmTransformerWasmUrl);
  return lowerI64Imports(wasmBinary);
};

// Let's create our Wasm Terminal
const wasmTerminal = new WasmTerminal({
  // Function that is run whenever a command is fetched
  fetchCommand: fetchCommandHandler
  // IMPORTANT: This is wherever your process.worker.js file URL is hosted
  processWorkerUrl: "/node_modules/wasm-terminal/workers/process.worker.js",
});

// Let's print out our initial message
wasmTerminal.print("Hello World!");

// Let's bind our Wasm terminal to it's container
const containerElement = document.querySelector("#root");
wasmTerminal.open(containerElement);
wasmTerminal.fit();
wasmTerminal.focus();

// Later, when we are done with the terminal, let's destroy it
wasmTerminal.destroy();
```

**Css**

We must also include the `[xterm](https://github.com/xtermjs/xterm.js/).css`. For example:

```html
<!-- This includes the external stylesheet. NOTE: The path should point to wherever you are hosting the wasm-terminal output. -->
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  type="text/css"
  href="node_modules/wasm-terminal/xterm/xterm.css"
/>
```

## Wasm Terminal Reference API

### WasmTerminal

`new WasmTerminal(WasmTerminalConfig)`

Constructor for the WasmTerminal, that returns an instance of the WasmTerminal.

The [WasmTerminalConfig](./lib/wasm-terminal-config.ts) can be described as the following:

```typescript
{
  // Function that is called whenever a command is entered and returns a Promise,
  // It takes in the name of the command being run, and expects a Uint8Array of a Wasm Binary, or a
  // CallbackCommand (see the api below) to be returned.
  fetchCommand: (commandName: string) => Promise<Uint8Array | CallbackCommand>
  // URL to the /node_modules/wasm-terminal/workers/process.worker.js . This is used by the shell to
  // to spawn web workers in Comlink, for features such as piping, /dev/stdin reading, and general performance enhancements.
  processWorkerUrl?: string;
}
```

CallbackCommands are functions that can be returned in the `fetchCommand` config property. They are simply Javascript callback that take in the command arguments and command stdin, and returns a Promise that resolves stdout. Since these callback commands handle `stdin` and `stdout`, that can be used as normal commands that can be piped!

```typescript
export type CallbackCommand = (
  args: string[],
  stdin: string
) => Promise<string | undefined>;
```

---

`wasmTerminal.open(containerElement: Element)`

Function to set the container of the `wasmTerminal`. `containerElement` can be any [Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element).

---

`wasmTerminal.fit()`

Function to resize the terminal to fit the size of its container.

---

`wasmTerminal.focus()`

Function to [focus](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLElement/focus) on the `wasmTerminal` element, and allow input into the shell.

---

`wasmTerminal.print(message: string)`

Function to print text to the wasmTerminal. Useful for printing a welcome message before the wasmTerminal is opened.

### fetchCommandFromWAPM

`fetchCommandFromWAPM(commandName: string) => Promise<Uint8Array>`

Function meant to be returned in the `fetchCommand` config property of the WasmTerminal Class. This takes in the name of command, and returns a Promise that resolves a Uint8Array of the Wasm binary from WAPM.

## Browser Compatibility

For more simple Wasm modules, E.g [cowsay](https://wapm.io/package/cowsay), the Wasm terminal will work on the latest version of all major browsers. However, more complex Wasm modules may only work on browsers that support [SharedArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer). Which was previously implemented in all major browsers, but was removed due to the [Meltdown and Spectre attacks](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#Browser_compatibility). Though, some major browsers have already started to re-enable this feature. The following cases that may be problemsome are:

- Wasm modules that infinitely loop like [wasm-matrix](https://github.com/torch2424/wasm-matrix). They will block the main thread and freeze the browser.

- Wasm modules that take in input from `/dev/stdin` such as [lolcat](https://wapm.io/package/lolcat). They will not take input from the shell. but instead, use [`window.prompt`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/prompt) to get input. Since `window.prompt` can pause the execution of javascript on the main thread for synchronous reads.

## Contributing

The project is split up around the relationship between a [terminal, tty, and shell](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/4126/what-is-the-exact-difference-between-a-terminal-a-shell-a-tty-and-a-con).

This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification.

Contributions of any kind are welcome! üëç
