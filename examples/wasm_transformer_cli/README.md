# wasm_transformer_cli

A very simple cli tool for running the [wasm_transformer](../../crates/wasm_transformer) crate, just to test it's usage with rust.

Built this CLI tool by following [this guide](https://mattgathu.github.io/writing-cli-app-rust/).

For a "how to" on running this CLI, run `./run.sh` to use the default `cargo run` configuration.
